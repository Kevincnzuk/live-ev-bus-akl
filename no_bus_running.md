# Why am I seeing "Hmm, seems like no bus is running."?

This could result from multiple reasons, some possibilities are listed below.

1. No bus is operating - Between 2 am and 5 am literally no buses are out running, including diesel. Wait till the first bus of the day is out and running (normally after 5 am). Or if extreme weather approaches, AT may suspend all buses till it is safe to do so, but do check [AT Travel Alerts](https://twitter.com/AT_TravelAlerts) for confirmation.
2. You have no internet connection - Unlikely if you can still see this text. You could [do a speed test](https://www.chorus.co.nz/speed-test).
3. Other reasons - Pull a [issue](https://github.com/Kevincnzuk/live-ev-bus-akl/issues) here on GitHub and I will have a look. Attach as much information as you possibly can.
