# AKL Live EV Bus

This is the official distribution page for the `AKL Live EV Bus` app. Please take a look at the information below on how to use it.

We support Auckland Transport's [Mission Electric](https://at.govt.nz/about-us/sustainability/mission-electric/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This app is a Java-based Android-only app. Apologies to iOS / iPadOS users as only Mac can do iOS / iPadOS developments but I do not have one with me.
> - This app requires Android `8.0` (Oreo) or above to operate.
> - This app is **NOT** a replacement for well-structured PT realtime apps like *AT Mobile*, *Google Maps*, *AnyTrip* or *Transit*. As an enthusiastic project, we have very limited resources available compared to these big companies and cannot offer auto-refresh functions in-app.
> - All real-time data presented in the app came from [Auckland Transport](https://at.govt.nz/about-us/at-data-sources); All map data came from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright); This repository has zero liability for incorrect data presentation.

## Features

- [x] A list showing all current electric & new energy buses.
- [x] A map visually presenting all electric & new energy buses operating currently.
- [x] A neat Material 3 UI & Dark mode adapted.
- [x] Detail page showing all about this bus.
- [ ] _Bus search._
- [ ] _Photo library for bus (in terms of model and/or fleet no.)_
- [ ] _Data structure changed from `JSON` to `SQL` (TBA)_
- [ ] _Connection to AnyTrip (TBA depends on availability)_

> [!NOTE]
> We are facing problems due to the "zero server" target and the lack of resources available to be used, update progress may be slow.

## Screenshots

_Will be available once the app becomes more complete..._

## Get started

This instruction will guide you through the preparation work before start using the app itself.

### Download and install
Go to the [Release](https://github.com/Kevincnzuk/live-ev-bus-akl/releases) page and seek the green `Latest` tag (or the latest `Pre-Release` tag) and download the relevant `.apk` file.

Follow the instructions from your device to install it.

### Get an API Key

This step is mandatory as each subscriber has a per-minute and weekly cap.

Each subscriber (primary and secondary key counts together) can run 600 calls/minute up to a maximum of 35000 calls/week. To avoid my key exceeding this limit, it is better if every user uses their dedicated key.

Please also be advised that every refresh of the data set (the main list) **will count as one call**. All other functions, including map, use the data available in the list and thus do not make an extra call.

#### Step by step

1. Go to [Auckland Transport Developer Portal](https://dev-portal.at.govt.nz) and sign in / sign up for an account.
2. Subscribe to the `Public Transport Dev` channel.
3. Go to your `Profile`, under `Subscription` you will see a list like this:

![Key](images/keys.png)

4. Click `Show` and copy the `Primary Key` of the keys to the app's `Setting`, where an input field requires you to enter a `Primary Key`. You may also copy the `Secondary Key` in but it is optional.
5. Click `Save` on the top right, and return to the main page. Swipe down to refresh.

### Ready to use

You are ready to go!

## Provide Feedback

- [New function recommendation](https://github.com/Kevincnzuk/live-ev-bus-akl/discussions/categories/ideas)
- [Issues with the app](https://github.com/Kevincnzuk/live-ev-bus-akl/issues)

## Troubleshooting

- [Data source currently unavailable.](no_datasets.md)
- [Hmm, seems like no bus is running.](no_bus_running.md)

### Known issues

- [ ] If the main list is empty (regardless of not initialised or no bus is running), using the map function will cause the app to crash with `java.lang.NullPointerException`.
- [ ] Go Bus <span color="#f3921a">AirportLink</span> Yutong E12 buses have no rego displaying -- This is an AT problem, they did not provide it in the API, and we only display things in the API or from the `datasets` folder of this repository.
- [x] If the `Route` is displaying a 5-digit number, it is also an AT problem for returning the old v2 API that has been deprecated for over half a year, while this app is based on the newest v3 API.
- [x] `HE0601` is designed to have a dedicated hydrogen label but still displays `Electric` in the list. - Fixed, the error caused by `"FCV" â‰  "fcv"`.

## Can I download a copy of the source code and develop one for my city?

Yes, and that is one of the purposes I open-source it. Programming is a tool with unlimited imagination, we should get to use the most from it.

However, do pay attention to the conditions in the GPL-3.0 license, you need to follow them if you use copies of my code.
